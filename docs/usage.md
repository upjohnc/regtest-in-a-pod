# Usage

Start the podman machine and `RegtestBitcoinEnv` container to fire up all services:

```shell
cd ~/podman/regtest-in-a-pod/
just start

# Alternatively, use
podman machine start regtest
podman start RegtestBitcoinEnv
```

## Commands

The best way to explore what the regtest environment can do is to take a look at the `justfile` in the root of the repository, or use the `just` command to list all available commands.
